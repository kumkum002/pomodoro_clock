POMODORO TIMER: 

This project is a simple Pomodoro timer built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows you to implement the Pomodoro Technique, a time management method that involves focused work intervals followed by short breaks.

Features:

25-minute timer: 
The default timer duration is 25 minutes, aligning with the Pomodoro Technique's recommended work interval.

Start/Stop/Reset buttons:
Control the timer easily with dedicated buttons for starting, stopping, and resetting the countdown.

Visual countdown:
A circular progress bar visually represents the remaining time, helping you stay focused.

Customization: 
Choose custom timer durations for different tasks or preferences.
